Objects 

1=> Difference between primitive and non primitive values .

# There are several primitive datatypes string,boolean,null,undefined etc.
# Primitive datatypes are immutable which means the value or part of them cant be changed as they are stored as a whole in memory they are not stored as reference 
# But we can reaasign the primitive value where as the old value will be garbage collected.

Non Primitive Datatype 

# They are mutable which means the value can be changed completly as they are stored by reference.

Example of Primitive.

let name = 'Rishabh';
name[2]='h';  => This can't be happend here because just because of immutable property 

name ='NewName'
if i assign new name the whole previous value would be garbage collected.

Example of non-primitve 

let books = {name:"Share market"};
books.name="Trading";
output // Share Market

# Comparision of Primitve and Non Primitive 

1 Primitve datatypes are compared by values if two values are equal they return true.
2 Non primitve datatypes are compared by reference regardless of values in both the object are equal they still gonna return false until they are pointing to same memory location.

example.

let name = 'Rishabh';
let name2 = 'Rishabh';
console.log(name==name2); // True

let book = {name:"Rishabh",age:21};
let book2 = {name:"Rishabh",age:21}; // if compared returns false unless i'll make them point to the one memory location.
book = book2; now they pointing to the same memory location.

# How Primitve and Non-Primitive Datatypes are stored ?

1) Primitive datatypes as they are smaller in size, fixed and doesn't grows in future they are stored in stack because they are lightweight and can be accessible faster.
2) Non primitive datatypes are stored under heaps because they are made for complex datatypes and may be grow in sizes which can be easily handled by heap
3) But here comes a corner case  whenever we create an object let object = {} // Now as they are stored by reference so the pointer is bsically store in stack and the actual object is stored in heap


# Now the question arise what basically an Object is ?

1) We've already got to know object as non primitive datatypes but the values in objects are stored as a keyed collection which is key and values and are know as properties.
2) for example => let obj = {name:"Rishabh"};
3) Always remember object keys are strings but value can be anything.

# How to create an empty object

1) let obj = new Object();
2) let obj = {}; //These are the two ways to create Object literals

example for creating an Object 

let obj = 
{
    name:"Rishabh",
    age:21
}

Now question arise how to access these values we can access them using dot notation.

# I can add or remove the value whenever we want to we can delete the values using delete obj.name and if we need to add obj.something = "";

1) If we use multiword properties they must be quotes properly and they aren't accessed using dot notation but they are accessed using sqaure bracket.

# Property Name limitations => This mean we cannot use reserve keywords as a properties name like for let return etc 
# In operator is used to check if values exists in an object but remember we need to include that in double quotes the property name "Age" in Object Name.

# loop in an object   
=> We got for in loop which loops over  the keys but it can also we looped over an object values .

for instance;

let name = 
{
    firstName: " Rishabh",
    lastName: "Sehgal"
}
for(key in name)
{
    console.log(key) // loops over both of the keys 
    console.log(name[key]) // loops over the values of object
}


Summary Doc 1  (# Reference Object Doc)
Objects are associative arrays with several special features.

They store properties (key-value pairs), where:

Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings).
Values can be of any type.
To access a property, we can use:

The dot notation: obj.property.
Square brackets notation obj["property"]. Square brackets allow taking the key from a variable, like obj[varWithKey].
Additional operators:

To delete a property: delete obj.prop.
To check if a property with the given key exists: "key" in obj.
To iterate over an object: for (let key in obj) loop.
What we’ve studied in this chapter is called a “plain object”, or just Object.

There are many other kinds of objects in JavaScript:

Array to store ordered data collections,
Date to store the information about the date and time,
Error to store the information about an error.
…And so on.
They have their special features that we’ll study later. Sometimes people say something like “Array type” or “Date type”, but formally they are not types of their own, but belong to a single “object” data type. And they extend it in various ways.

Objects in JavaScript are very powerful. Here we’ve just scratched the surface of a topic that is really huge. We’ll be closely working with objects and learning more about them in further parts of the tutorial.
